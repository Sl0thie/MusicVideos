# MusicVideos
A web application that provides a html player for a smart tv and a html remote for a smart phone to make a video jukebox. It uses SignalR to communicate between the pages and the server.

The remote provides the ability to filter the list of videos as well as control the playback. Volume can also be adjusted, this is currently being extended to include a video by video volume offset to provide a manual adjustment to level the volume between videos.

There is also a html page for neighbours to access to notifiy their disgust at how loud my teenager's are playing their music. Its still in progress though.
